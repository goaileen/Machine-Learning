# Machine-Learning
Automatically identify the subject of posts from Piazza using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

The learning goals of this project include Function Objects and Recursion. Reinforces learning goals like Container ADTs, Dynamic Memory, The Big Three, Linked Lists, and Iterators. Gains experience with recursion, binary trees, templates, comparators, and the map data structure.

For example, the program will be able to read a Piazza post and figure out that itâ€™s about Euchre.
